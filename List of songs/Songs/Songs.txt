Nightquest
Nightwish
1998
Born to the false world, the wanderer,
Storyteller, The Pied Piper
On a quest for immortality
Gathering a troop to find the fantasy
Led by a maid - Queen of the night
Voice of angels, such a divine sight
An Amazon to fight and cure
This reality with her feline lure
Patriotic to the promised land 
Of Neverwaking Dream
Nightquest - quest not for the past
But for tomorrow to make it last
Simply the best - way to walk this life
Hand in hand with the dreamers'minds
Enter the realm, don't stay awake
The dreams remain, they only brake
Forget the task, enjoy the ride
And follow us into the night
A merry minstrel with his fingers fast
Playing his lute, charming every lass
Joins the troop with a glitter in his eye
"Shall I find fame or shall I die"
A warrior of power along the path
A hammerheart, his gallantry to last
Rhythm of sirens, enemies, take heed
For in this war laws are a silent sleep
Patriotic to the promised land 
Of Neverwaking Dream
Nightquest - quest not for the past
But for tomorrow to make it last
Simply the best - way to walk this life
Hand in hand with the dreamers'minds
Enter the realm, don't stay awake
The dreams remain, they only brake
Forget the task, enjoy the ride
And follow us into the night
"Come to the elfland" the eldest said,
"In my guidance you shall not be afraid,
I am the mastermind, the wizard to show the way"
Nightquest - quest not for the past
But for tomorrow to make it last
Simply the best - way to walk this life
Hand in hand with the dreamers' minds
Enter the realm, don't stay awake
The dreams remain, they only brake
Forget the task, enjoy the ride
And follow us into the night
First ones to guard this path of night
Lady in black, Lady in white
Followed by legions of night-time wanderers
Guardians of the halls of heart
When we from our homeland depart
To challenge the gods of emptiness
May the quest begin

Stargazers
Nightwish
1998
A grand oasis in the vastness of gloom
Child of dew-spangled cobweb Mother to the moon
Constellations beholders of the 3rd vagrant
Theater for the play of life
Tragedienne of heavens
Watching the eyes of the night
Sailing the virgin oceans
A planetride for the Mother and Child
Floating upon the quiet hydrogen lakes
In this ambrosial merry-go-round they will gaze
Ephemereal life touched by a billion-year show
Separating the poet from the woe
Tragedienne of heavens...
Oracle of the Delphian Domine
Witness of Adam's frailty
Seer of the master prophecy
The stellar world her betrothed
Wanderers in cosmic caravan
Universal bond - The Starborn
A son in the search for the truth
Following the pages of Almagest
Discovering the origin of dreams
Stargazers ride through the ancient realms
Tragedienne of heavens...

Casablanca
Xandria
2003
At the temple of black gods I failed again
For you - a chilvarous end for a man
Clandestine enthralling haze
A docile sacrifice for your grace 
Resurrect from the ban they put on you
Fall again - you will - what they foreknew
Only gods illuminate
And just a slave to be is my fate 
And you will hear me
Siren's calls of temptation
Teasing you
No limit will be
No taboo of imagination
I'll fill your void 
I will always savour you
As I will always be your fool

Kill The Sun
Xandria
2003
I am down at the water
My bare feet are numb
And for aeons now nothing seems real 
Now it's hard to hold sight
Through your soft eiderdown
But I still got my hands on the wheel 
You have set my mind
Between worlds spinning round
I'm a stranger in my universe 
But I see my sun
And I know that it will
Be forever shining on earth 
You can rain down on me
But you can't darken the sun
You can cast a spell on the moon
But you can't kill the sun

Беспонтовый пирожок
Гражданская оборона
2004
Лишь одно в моём кармане -
Беспонтовый пирожок
Каждый из нас -
Беспонтовый пирожок
Каждый день свою я сумку
Свою сумку охранял
Всю свою жизнь
Я сумку охранял.
На Оке и на Кубани
Крутят всякое говно
Любит народ наш
Всякое говно.
Ни оконцев, ни дверцов
А полна жопа огурцов
Наша страна -
Полна жопа огурцов
Всякая страна -
Полна жопа огурцов.
Лишь одно в моём кармане -
Беспонтовый пирожок
Каждый из нас -
Беспонтовый пирожок.
